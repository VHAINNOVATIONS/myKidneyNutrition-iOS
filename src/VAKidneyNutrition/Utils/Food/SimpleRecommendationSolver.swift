/**
 * Most simple implementation of RecommendationDecision:
 *   It checks if the given food includes goal's nutrition and returns RecommendationSolution.reduce. Very simple.
 *   The aim of this implementation to debug the app and may be to incorporate in move complex implementations of RecommendationSolver.
 *   The actually used RecommendationSolver implementation can be re-defined later with consultation with experts. For now it's not nessesary.
